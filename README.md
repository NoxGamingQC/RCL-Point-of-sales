# Royal Canadian Legion
This project is stricly for the Royal Canadian Legion, it provides, the branch website, a POS system and a dashboard. Can work with other branch. You can reach out to me if you want your branch to be added. Once added everything is maintained by the branch itself.

## Why I did this project?

I'm a member of branch 06-101. I did this project to provide help to our veterans to managed our branch and modernized our website (We didn't get the original domain just yet, that is why it is hosted on my website)
